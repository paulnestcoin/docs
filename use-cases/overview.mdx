At its core, Onboard is a *value exchange* protocol powered by an EVM-compatible smart contract escrow. This flexibility enables a broad range of use cases beyond crypto-fiat swaps. 

Examples of how the Onboard Protocol can be used include, but are not limited to:

- [Crypto to fiat ramps](/use-cases/on-off-ramps)
- [Crypto swaps](/use-cases/crypto-nft-swaps#crypto-swaps)
- [NFT swaps](/use-cases/crypto-nft-swaps#nft-swaps)
- [Services & e-commerce marketplaces](/use-cases/marketplaces)
- [Decentralized lending](/use-cases/lending)
