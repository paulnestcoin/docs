title: Crypto-fiat on and off-ramping
---

One of Onboard Protocolâ€™s primary use cases is facilitating on and off-ramping, allowing users to convert between digital assets and fiat currencies. This use case is essential for providing liquidity and accessible platforms that allow users enter and exit the crypto ecosystem.

An example of this is the Onboard Exchange marketplace, which integrates the Onboard protocol. This marketplace is accessible to everyday users, onboards liquidity providers, and supports various channels for depositing and withdrawing fiat in different currencies.
