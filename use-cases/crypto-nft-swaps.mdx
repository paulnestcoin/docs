### Crypto swaps

In addition to fiat-based swaps, the escrow system can support P2P-based atomic crypto swaps, providing a cost-effective alternative to conventional crypto bridges.

Consider a scenario where User A holds USDT on Base and seeks USDT on the Optimism network. Through a marketplace using the Onboard escrow, User A can be matched with another individual, User B who has provided liquidity for USDT on the Optimism network and seeks USDT on Base.

User B’s USDT (Optimism) is securely locked in escrow, awaiting the transfer of USDT (Base) by User A to the User B’s wallet. Once this is complete, the USDT on Optimism is released from escrow and transferred to User A.


### NFT Swaps

Similar to atomic crypto swaps, the protocol’s escrow can be extended to NFT marketplaces. Users can explore more flexible exchange options, including direct NFT swaps for other NFTs or fiat-to-NFT swaps. The escrow ensures NFTs are securely locked and safely transferred between users, thereby reducing the risk of fraud.
