## The Onboard Ecosystem

To begin, we should make clear the distinctions between the different areas of "Onboard", some of which may confuse new users.

- **The Onboard Protocol:** A suite of smart contracts that enable the peer-to-peer exchange of assets on EVM-compatible blockchains. Onboard Protocol can be integrated at the [SDK](https://google.com) and [smart contract](https://google.com) level.
- **Onboard Exchange:** The first dApp powered by the Onboard Protocol. It is a web-based marketplace that matches buyers and sellers to swap crypto tokens to fiat currencies and vice-versa in different markets. By open-sourcing the Onboard Protocol, anyone else can build applications similar to Onboard Exchange.
- **Onboard Connect:** Onboard Connect is the SDK & API integration layer for Onboard Exchange, targeted at Web2 and Web3 developers who want access to the ready-made marketplace & liquidity Onboard Exchange offers.
