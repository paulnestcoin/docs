title: 'Generate OTP for 2FA actions'
openapi: get /users/me/send-otp
---

Generates a one-time password (OTP) for actions requiring two-factor authentication (2FA), such as:

- Adding or updating a payment method
- Updating account security settings (e.g. enabling passkeys & TOTP)

This OTP does not grant authentication access but is instead used to verify sensitive operations within an authenticated session.

<Note>For OTPs used for authentication (sign-in/sign-up), refer to the [`Verify auth OTP`](/api-reference/onboard-connect/users/api-user-creation/verify-user-auth-otp.mdx) endpoint.</Note>
