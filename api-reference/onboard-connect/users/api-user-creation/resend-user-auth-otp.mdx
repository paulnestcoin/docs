title: 'Resend User Authentication OTP'
openapi: post /auth/user-auth/resend-otp
---

Resends the OTP to the user's email for authentication during sign-in or sign-up. Use this if the previous OTP was not received by the user, or has expired.

<Warning>
This endpoint is specifically for user authentication (logging in or signing up).

Do not confuse it with the [2FA OTP](/api-reference/onboard-connect/users/generate-otp-for-2fa-actions.mdx) endpoint, which generates OTPs for verifying sensitive account actions (e.g., updating payment methods).
</Warning>
