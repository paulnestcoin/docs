Onboard allows 3rd party applications to create and authenticate users seamlessly through API endpoints. This process ensures that users can be onboarded quickly and securely.

## Overview
User creation via API follows a simple flow:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Initiate authentication">
        Send a request via the [**Initiate**](initiate-user-authentication) endpoint to authenticate a user. If the provided email does not exist, a new Onboard profile is automatically created.
    </Step>
    <Step title="OTP verification">
        The user receives an OTP via email and must verify it using the [**Verify Auth OTP**](verify-user-auth-otp) endpoint to complete authentication.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Resend OTP (if needed)">
        If the OTP is not received or has expired, trigger a resend via the [**Resend Auth OTP**](resend-user-auth-otp) endpoint.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Refresh token">
        Once authenticated, refresh tokens as needed using the [**Refresh Token**](refresh-oauth-token) endpoint to maintain access without re-authentication.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Additional Notes
- This flow applies to both new and existing users.
- OTPs are required to confirm identity before access is granted.
- For security, OTPs expire after a set duration and must be verified within that time.

For full implementation details, refer to the API reference for each endpoint.
