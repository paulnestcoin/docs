## Overview

To interact with the Onboard Connect API, 3rd party clients must authenticate using one of the following methods:

- **Session-based authentication (`x-auth-token`)** - Used for requests requiring an authenticated user session.
- **API Key authentication (`x-api-key`)** - Used to identify your 3rd party application.
- **HMAC Signature authentication** - Required for more sensitive endpoints (e.g., user creation), ensuring request integrity.

<Tip>
Check the specific endpoint documentation to determine which authentication method is required.

## Authentication methods

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Session-Based Authentication">
        Used for endpoints requiring an authenticated user session.

        Steps:
        Obtain an `x-auth-token` after completing user authentication (e.g., OTP login).

        Include this token in the request headers:

        ```http
        Authorization: Bearer <x-auth-token>
        ```

        **Example Request:**
        ```http
        GET /users/me
        Authorization: Bearer <x-auth-token>
        ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="API Key Authentication">
        Some endpoints require your API key to identify your application as the requesting 3rd party client.

        Steps:
        1. [Retrieve your API key](/onboard-exchange/connect/quick-start-guide) from the Business Dashboard after onboarding.
        2. Include the API key in either:

        <CodeGroup>
            ```http Request Headers
            x-api-key: <your-api-key>
            ```

            ```http URL Query Parameter
            GET /exchange/api/orders/trade-url&apiKey=<your-api-key>&product=web3&tradeType=sell&fiat=NGN&token=USDT&tokenAmount=1&networkId=bsc_testnet&autoselect=true
            ```
        </CodeGroup>

        <Note> Some endpoints require `x-api-key` while others do not. Check the endpoint's documentation to confirm.</Note>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="HMAC Signature Authentication">
        Certain sensitive endpoints, such as user creation, require an HMAC SHA-256 signature for verification. Requests without a valid signature will be rejected.

        ### Required Headers:
        |Header	| Description |
        |-----------|----------|
        |x-api-key|	Found in the Business Dashboard|
        |x-signature|	HMAC-SHA256 signature of the request body|
        |x-timestamp|	Unix timestamp (seconds) when the signature was generated|

        ### How to generate `x-signature`
        The signature is generated using HMAC SHA-256 with your API secret as the key.

        **Example (JavaScript):**
        ```javascript
        const crypto = require('crypto');

        const timestamp = Math.ceil(Date.now() / 1000);
        const apiSecret = "Onboard API secret"; // Found in the Business Dashboard
        const requestBody = JSON.stringify({ /* your request body */ });

        const params = [`t=${timestamp}`, requestBody].join('&');
        const signature = crypto.createHmac('sha256', apiSecret).update(params).digest('hex');

        console.log(`x-signature: ${signature}`);
        ```

        ### Making a secure API request
        Include the following headers in your request:

        ```http
        x-api-key: <your-api-key>
        x-signature: <computed-signature>
        x-timestamp: <epoch-timestamp>
        ```
        <Note>`x-timestamp` must be within 30 seconds of the current time. Older timestamps will result in a 403 Forbidden error.</Note>

<Warning>
    **Unauthorized Requests:** Endpoints that require authentication will return a 401 Unauthorized status code for missing or invalid credentials.
