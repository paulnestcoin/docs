title: 'Authentication'
---

To interact with the Onboard Connect API, clients must authenticate using either an `x-auth-token` or, in some cases, an API key.

## Authentication steps

1. **Obtain credentials:** Retrieve your API key from the Business Dashboard after completing the onboarding process. See the [Getting started](/onboard-exchange/connect/quick-start-guide.mdx) guide for instructions.
2. **Include authentication details:** Depending on the endpoint, add either of the following to your API requests:
    - `x-auth-token`: Required in the request header for authentication.
    - API key: Some endpoints require the public API key to be included as a query parameter to identify your integration.

<Warning>
**Unauthorized Requests:** Endpoints that require authentication will return a 401 Unauthorized status code for missing or invalid credentials.
