title: 'Start trade'
openapi: get /exchange/orders/trade
---

This endpoint is ideal for low-code integrations, and can be used in place of [`Fetch Trade URL`](/api-reference/onboard-connect/orders/fetch-trade-url), which returns the trade url in JSON.

Instead, the `Start trade` endpoint automatically resolves to the trade URL, and is best used to initiate trades within a browser or webview.


To initiate orders natively via APIs, use:

- [/transactions/v2/onramp/initiate](/api-reference/onboard-connect/orders/initiate-onramp-order) for onramp transactions
- [/transactions/v2/offramp/initiate]((/api-reference/onboard-connect/orders/initiate-offramp-order)) for offramp transactions
