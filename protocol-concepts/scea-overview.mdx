title: 'SCEA Overview'

A typical value exchange marketplace involves a buyer who wants to purchase assets and sellers offering those assets for sale. These parties interact through an intermediary platform, which provides discovery, trust, and mediation services.

Traditionally, secure transactions in these marketplaces rely on a centralized escrow managed by the platform. However, this approach creates a single point of failure, raising concerns about insolvency, platform restrictions, or fraud.

## The Smart Contract Escrow Account (SCEA)

Onboard has developed a decentralized escrow system to enable value exchanges in a trustless, permissionless manner.

This core idea behind this system is a Smart Contract Escrow Account (SCEA) created on the blockchain.

### SCEA Key Functionalities

- **Storage of assets:** store assets not locked in an ongoing transaction, similar an [externally-owned account](https://google.com). This is known as the `AvailableBalance`.
- **Escrow Lock:** lock tokens being transacted during an ongoing exchange in the `LockedBalance`.
- **Deposits & Withdrawals:** assets deposited directly into the address, or transferred after a transaction, are stored as `AvailableBalance`. The owner of the SCEA can withdraw this `AvailableBalance` at anytime.

There are a number of things to note with the SCEA:
