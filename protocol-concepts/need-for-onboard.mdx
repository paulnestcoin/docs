title: The Need for Onboard
description: 'Why the Onboard Protocol was built'
---

Crypto’s original promise, as envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto in the [original Bitcoin whitepaper](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/1/), has been to provide an open and permissionless financial system - where anyone in the world can participate, ownership rights can’t be tampered with, and money preserves its value over time.

Statistics from the World Bank show potential for the impact of this system — there are over 1.7 billion adults across ~~Africa &~~ the global south who should benefit from access to global opportunities. However, low economic freedom and rampant inflation prevents them from participating in the global economy.

Onboarding these users onchain is crucial to achieving crypto’s fundamental purpose: enabling economic freedom.

Yet, accessibility still remains a challenge. Emerging markets where people need crypto the most — countries with the lowest degrees of economic freedom — often lack the necessary entry points. A large percentage of people (e.g. 80% in Sub-Saharan Africa) rely on cash, which is conventionally difficult to convert to digital assets.

To learn more about the motivation for the protocol, see the [Onboard whitepaper](https://google.com).

### Current Gaps

Existing exchange and on-ramping platforms have several limitations that make them less accessible for users and developers. Some of the common ones include:

    For many exchanges and on-ramps, setting up in new countries incurs significant time and effort, thereby excluding users from those countries. Additionally, exchanges may abruptly exit from certain jurisdictions, leaving users scrambling for alternatives.

    Onboard’s permissionless protocol aims to eliminate geographical barriers to the on-chain economy. The protocol is entirely open for public use without restriction, is designed so that anyone with sufficient experience can easily set up a secure marketplace of buyers and sellers using the protocol.
    
    For example, the aforementioned Onboard Exchange recently spun up new marketplaces in Kenya, Uganda and Ghana in as little as 2 weeks.

  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Custodial risk">
    centralized exchanges hold user funds, exposing users to the risk of exchange insolvency, frozen or lost funds.
    
    Onboard’s non-custodial approach eliminates this risk and frees the developer from the liability of managing users’ funds. Even in cases of disputes, withdrawals can only be made to either buyer or seller, and not to 3rd party addresses.
