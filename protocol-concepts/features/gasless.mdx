title: Gasless Transactions
---

The Onboard protocol enables gasless transactions by implementing the **`permit`** function, allowing end users of the protocol to lock funds in escrow without paying gas fees.

The `permit` functionality leverages EIP-2612, a standard for users to grant permission to others to spend their tokens in a single transaction, simplifying the process of approving token transfers. 

When a user is selling crypto, the user signs a gasless approval message, which authorizes the protocol `initiator` to pay gas on the userâ€™s behalf for that transaction.

For `ERC-20` tokens that don't support the native **`permit`** function, Onboard integrates Uniswap's `Permit2`.

Using `Permit2`, customers must make an initial approval transaction with gas fees, after which the `Permit2` contract handles subsequent transactions without further gas costs.
