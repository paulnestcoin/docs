title: Initiation & Mediation
---

In the protocol's original design, the platform's interaction with the SCEA was via a `mediator` attribute, granted permission by the `owner` to initiate transactions by locking funds in escrow, and also confirm transactions in the event of a dispute.

However, having a single entity responsible for both order initiation and mediation introduced risks of overexposure and overdependence on a single point of failure.

## Separation of Concerns

To enhance the system's security and decentralization, two separate entities, each with different private keys, are now responsible for initiation and mediation respectively.

### `Initiator`
    - The initiator is now solely responsible for order initiation and locking funds in escrow.
    - Users grant the initiator permission to initiate transactions and lock their funds in escrow.
    - This separation ensures that the initiatorâ€™s actions are limited to the transaction initiation phase, reducing the risk of overexposure.

### `Mediator`
    - The mediator handles order confirmation and the resolution of disputes.
    - In cases of disputes, the mediator confirms the orders and transfers the tokens to the appropriate party (buyer or seller).
    - The mediator operates with a separate private key, ensuring a clear distinction and independence from the initiator.
