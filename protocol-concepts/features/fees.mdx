title: Fees & Fee Recipient
---

The protocol includes a flexible fee structure that developers can leverage when creating off-ramp orders. Fees are a crucial part of the transaction process, and this implementation ensures that they are handled transparently and flexibly.

## Fee Parameters in Trade Creation

The following code snippet illustrates how fee parameters are supplied during the creation of off-ramp orders in the `EscrowOfframp` contract:

```solidity

// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED

pragma solidity ^0.8.25;

contract EscrowOfframp {

    struct ClientArgs {
        address client;
    }

    /// @notice This will lock `_amount` in escrow
    /// @param _amount coin amount to off ramp
    /// @param _tradeFee Onboard trade fee
    function createOfframpOrder(uint256 _amount, uint256 _tradeFee ) external {
        // Create off-ramp order and keep record of trade fee
        // Lock trade amount in escrow
    }

    /// @notice It is expected that order amount has been pre-approved by customer to escrow account
    /// @param _token ERC20 token address
    /// @param _amount coin amount to off ramp
    function createOfframpOrder(IERC20 _token, uint256 _amount, uint256 _tradeFee ) external {
        // Verify if amount is approved by user to be locked in escrow
        // Keep trade record including the fee to be charged
        // Lock trade amount in escrow
    }

    // @notice Mediator confirms order in dispute cases
    function confirmOfframpOrder(ClientArgs memory args) external returns(bool success) {
        // Ensure that order exists for args client
        // Execute transfer of asset to merchant escrow account
        // Transfer trade fee to designated fee recipient address
    }
}

```

The `createOfframpOrder` function allows users to lock a specified amount of tokens in escrow.

During the creation of the off-ramp order, a `_tradeFee` parameter is supplied. This fee is recorded and associated with the transaction. There are two versions of this function:

- One that handles native tokens.
- One that deals with ERC20 tokens, ensuring the amount is pre-approved for transfer to the escrow account.

During order processing, the `confirmOfframpOrder` function ensures the existence of the order for the specified client and executes the transfer of assets to the merchant's escrow account. The `_tradeFee` is then transferred to a designated fee recipient address, ensuring that fees are collected appropriately.
