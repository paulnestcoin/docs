## Protocol Use Cases

At its core, Onboard is a *value exchange* protocol powered by an EVM-compatible smart contract escrow. This flexibility enables a broad range of use cases beyond crypto-fiat swaps. 

Examples of how the Onboard Protocol can be used include, but are not limited to:


### Crypto-fiat on and off-ramping

One of Onboard Protocol’s primary use cases is facilitating on and off-ramping, allowing users to convert between digital assets and fiat currencies. This use case is essential for providing liquidity and accessible platforms that allow users enter and exit the crypto ecosystem.

An example of this is the Onboard Exchange marketplace, which integrates the Onboard protocol. This marketplace is accessible to everyday users, onboards market makers, and supports various channels for depositing and withdrawing fiat in different currencies.

### Crypto swaps

In addition to fiat-based swaps, the escrow system can support P2P-based atomic crypto swaps, providing a cost-effective alternative to conventional crypto bridges.

Consider a scenario where User A holds USDT on Base and seeks USDT on the Optimism network. Through a marketplace using the Onboard escrow, User A can be matched with another individual, User B who has provided liquidity for USDT on the Optimism network and seeks USDT on Base.

User B’s USDT (Optimism) is securely locked in escrow, awaiting the transfer of USDT (Base) by User A to the User B’s wallet. Once this is complete, the USDT on Optimism is released from escrow and transferred to User A.


### NFT Swaps

Similar to atomic crypto swaps, the protocol’s escrow can be extended to NFT marketplaces. Users can explore more flexible exchange options, including direct NFT swaps for other NFTs or fiat-to-NFT swaps. The escrow ensures NFTs are securely locked and safely transferred between users, thereby reducing the risk of fraud.


### Services & e-commerce marketplaces

In online marketplaces and the gig economy, trust is a major challenge. Service providers may hesitate to deliver services without guaranteed payment, while customers might be apprehensive about paying upfront for services that may not be delivered.

The protocol's escrow enables secure transactions between “buyers” and “sellers” of goods and services in these environments.

In this use case, the “customer” deposits funds into the escrow smart contract before the transaction is initiated. Funds are automatically released to the service provider upon successful service delivery, and in case of disagreements, the protocol’s built-in dispute resolution mechanism ensures fair outcomes.


### Crypto loans

Onboard protocol’s smart escrow system can be integrated in decentralized lending platforms. Assets can be locked in the smart contract escrow, and then released to the borrower upon repayment of the loan. The assets may also be liquidated in favor of the borrower according to predetermined liquidation contracts.
