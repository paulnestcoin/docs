## Introduction

Onboard Protocol is a non-custodial peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol that enables secure exchange of assets in a trustless and globally accessible manner. Via Onboard, users can trade assets using their preferred self-custody crypto wallet, without the need for a centralized custodian to hold funds.

The protocol's core innovation is a [Smart Contract Escrow Account](/protocol-concepts/scea-overview), which securely locks assets during a trade, and only releases these assets after the explicit approval of both buyer and seller, or in cases of disputes, a mediator.

The Onboard Protocol can be deployed on all [EVM-compatible chains](https://defillama.com/chains/EVM): `Ethereum`, `Base`, `BNB Smart Chain`, `Polygon`, among others.
