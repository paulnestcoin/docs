Welcome to the Onboard Protocol docs! 

Here you'll find conceptual and technical documentation of the protocol, as well as everything you need to integrate and use Onboard in your applications.


## The Onboard Ecosystem

Before we get started, we should make clear the distinctions between the different areas of "Onboard", some of which may confuse new users.

- **Onboard Protocol:** A suite of open-source smart contracts that enable the peer-to-peer exchange of assets on EVM-compatible blockchains.
- **[Onboard Exchange](https://app.onboard.xyz):** The first dApp powered by the Onboard Protocol. It is a marketplace for crypto-fiat swaps across different currencies. With the Onboard Protocol, anyone can build dApps like Onboard Exchange.
- **[Onboard Connect](https://docs.onboardpay.co):**  The SDK & API integration layer for Onboard Exchange, targeted at Web2 and Web3 developers who want access to the ready-made marketplace & liquidity Onboard Exchange offers.
- **Onboard Team and Community:** The development of the Onboard Protocol and ecosystem is driven by the Onboard team and the broader community.
