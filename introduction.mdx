Welcome to the Onboard Protocol docs! 

Here you'll find conceptual and technical documentation of the protocol, as well as everything you need to integrate and use Onboard in your applications.


## The Onboard Ecosystem

Before we get started, we should make clear the distinctions between the different areas of "Onboard", some of which may confuse new users.

- **The Onboard Protocol:** A suite of smart contracts that enable the peer-to-peer exchange of assets on EVM-compatible blockchains. Onboard Protocol can be integrated at the [SDK](https://google.com) and [smart contract](https://google.com) level.
- **Onboard Exchange:** The first dApp powered by the Onboard Protocol. It is a web-based marketplace that matches buyers and sellers to swap crypto for different fiat currencies and vice-versa. Open-sourcing the Onboard Protocol allows anyone else build dApps similar to Onboard Exchange.
- **Onboard Connect:** Onboard Connect is the SDK & API integration layer for Onboard Exchange, targeted at Web2 and Web3 developers who want access to the ready-made marketplace & liquidity Onboard Exchange offers.
- **Onboard Team and Community:** The development of the Onboard Protocol and ecosystem is driven by the Onboard team and the broader community.
