Onboard Connect provides a simple way to integrate on/offramps with minimal development effort through a hosted widget.

## How It Works
Redirect users to a trade URL, where they can initiate and complete their transactions.

You can generate the trade URL in two ways:

1. **Retrieve the URL via API:** Use the [Get trade URL](/onboard-exchange/connect/api-examples#get-trade-url) endpoint to receive a trade URL in JSON format.
2. **Direct Resolution:** Call the [Start trade URL](/onboard-exchange/connect/api-examples#start-trade) endpoint, which directly resolves to the trade URL. This is suitable for initating trades via a browser or webview.

Both methods require:

- `<YOUR_API_KEY>`: Your API key from the Business Dashboard.
- `product=web3`: Specifies the Web3 product type.
- `<TRADE_QUERY_PARAMETERS>`: Customizable parameters that allow you to control the onramp and offramp experience for your users. You'll find details about these parameters in the section [below](#query-parameters).

## When to Use Low-Code Integration
- Rapid deployment without heavy development.
- Focus on a hosted, pre-built solution.
- No need for complex workflows.

## Exploring Native APIs
For advanced use cases, such as embedding custom flows or deeper integration with your app, explore the [Onboard Connect Native APIs](/api-reference). These provide programmatic control over trade initiation, user management, and offer retrieval, tailored to your specific requirements.
