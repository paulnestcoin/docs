In this quickstart, you'll learn how to integrate your Web3 wallet or dApp with Onboard Connect to provide easy and reliable onramps and offramps to your users.

<Tip>
**In a nutshell** <br/><br/>
Connect helps you initiate an on/offramp on your app by redirecting your user to a trade URL embedded with your API key and trading parameters.
</Tip>

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up to Connect">
    Here's how to get started:

    1. **Send an activation request:** Fill the API request form [here](https://tally.so/r/wzQYX1). Specify your use case and provide details about your product.
    2. **Get set up quickly:** Our team will get in touch to guide you through the next steps. Once approved, you'll get access to your [Business Dashboard](https://business.onboard.xyz).
    
    The Business Dashboard is your central portal for:
    - Generating your unique API key (which is used in the redirect link).
    - Configuring fees & additional settings for your integration.
    - Tracking your customers' completed onramp and offramp transactions.

    You'll also get access to a [sandbox](https://dev.business.onboard.xyz) where you can setup and test your integration in a development environment. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain your API Key">
    Log in to the Business Dashboard to [generate & retrieve your API key](https://business.onboard.xyz/api-keys). This API key is a required parameter within the redirect link used to initiate transactions.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Use in your app">
    To integrate Connect within your app, all you need is a trade URL, where your users are redirected to to initiate their order.

    The trade URL can be retrieved in two ways:

    1. By sending a GET request to the [Get trade URL](/onboard-exchange/connect/api-examples#get-trade-url) endpoint, which returns the trade URL as a JSON response.

    2. Calling the [Start trade URL](/onboard-exchange/connect/api-examples#start-trade) endpoint directly, which resolves to the trade URL. This is suitable for initating trades in a browser or webview.

    Both of these endpoints require the following key parameters:

    - `<YOUR_API_KEY>`: Replace this placeholder with your actual API key obtained from the Business Dashboard.
    - `product=web3`: This specifies the product type (web3 in this case).
    - `<TRADE_QUERY_PARAMETERS>`: These are a set of required & optional parameters that allow you to control the onramp and offramp experience for your users. You'll find details about these parameters in the section [below](#query-parameters).
    
    If all the required parameters in the trade URL are provided, the user is able to login and proceed with their trade on Onboard.
    
  </Step>
</Steps>
