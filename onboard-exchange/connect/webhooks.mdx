## Introduction

Webhooks enable your app get notified of events and state changes when interacting with Onboard's widget or API.

For instance, you'll receive a webhook notification when an order transitions from `INITIATED` to `DEPOSITED`.

## Setting up a webhook

To get started, configure a **publicly accessible** webhook URL from Onboard Connect's Settings in the Business portal dashboard.

<Frame>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/L2ifnr8.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

This URL must be able to:

- Return a `200 OK` HTTP status code with no response `body`.
- Accept the webhook payload (see structure [below](#webhook-payload-structure)).
- Verify the authenticity of the sender using the signature in the request header.

<Warning>If the webhook endpoint does not specify a `200 0K` HTTP response code on receipt of webhook data, there will be subsequent attempts to resend it until the retry attempts are exhausted.<br/><br/>Number of retry attempts is currently set at 3.</Warning>

## Verifying webhook origin

Since your webhook URL is publicly available, you need to verify that events originate from Onboard and not a bad actor.

To ensure this, each webhook attempt makes use of *signed HTTP headers*, which contain values you can use to verify the authenticity of the data being transmitted between Onboard and your application.

The following signed headers can be used:

### x-signature

- Here's an example, in Javascript, of how this parameter can be verified:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyWebhook(payload, signature, apiSecret) {
  const timestamp = payload.timestamp;
  const data = `t=${timestamp}&${JSON.stringify(payload.data)}`;
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', apiSecret)
    .update(data)
    .digest('hex');

  return expectedSignature === signature;
}
```

<Tip>The `apiSecret` is the same as the one configured from your Business portal dashboard.</Tip>

### x-timestamp
- This is the timestamp used to generate the signature

## Webhook payload structure
A webhook payload will typically conform to the structure below:

```json
{
  "event" : "<WEBHOOK_EVENT>", // Name of the event triggering the webhook
  "data" : {}, // Event-specific payload data
  "timestamp" : "1674775222" // Event timestamp in Unix format
}
```

<Tip>`data` is an object which is peculiar to the specific webhook context.</Tip>

## Supported webhook events

| Event | Description |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| order.state_transition | Triggered when an [order's state](#order-states) changes, such as from `INITIATED` to `DEPOSITED`. Includes detailed payload data for tracking.|

### Order states

| State | Description| Is terminal | Allowed transition |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | -------- | ----- |
| `PENDING`     | This is an order's initial state when instantiated by a user | No | `AWAITING_ACCEPTANCE`<br/> `INITIATED`<br/> `CANCELLED` |
| `AWAITING_ACCEPTANCE` | For orders that require prior acceptance before being initiated, this state indicates that the merchant is yet to accept the order. <br/><br/>This is usually because the merchant turned off auto-escrow on their ad, or the customer is selling an ERC-20 token. | No | `CANCELLED`<br/>`INITIATED` |
| `INITIATED` | The order has been create onchain, but the buyer hasn't confirmed sending fiat to the seller | No | `CANCELLED`<br/>`DEPOSITED`<br/>`IN_DISPUTE` |
| `DEPOSITED` | This indicates that the buyer has confirmed making a fiat transfer to the seller | No | `CONFIRMED`<br/>`CANCELLED`<br/>`IN_DISPUTE` |
| `CONFIRMED` | The seller has confirmed receipt of fiat | No | `COMPLETED` |
| `IN_DISPUTE` | A participant in the transaction has raised a dispute | No | `CANCELLED`<br/>`CONFIRMED` |
| `COMPLETED` | The order has been completed and closed on chain | Yes | N/A |
| `CANCELLED` | The order was cancelled | Yes | N/A |

<Tip>
A `terminal` state indicates that the state/status cannot be reversed, or transition to a different state.<br/><br/>It usually means the order has terminated, either as completed or cancelled.
