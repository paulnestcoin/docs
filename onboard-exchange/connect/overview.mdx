Onboard Connect is a low-code integration that allows developers embed on and off-ramp functionality directly into their Web3 wallets & dApps. You can integrate Connect on your website or mobile app by redirecting customers to a Onboard-hosted [redirect URL](/onboard-exchange/connect/quick-start-guide) embedded with [trade parameters](/onboard-exchange/connect/quick-start-guide#trade-parameters) accessible through the Onboard Exchange API.

Onboard Connect works with all tokens & networks supported by Exchange, along with over 30 local payment methods across different currencies, with additional support being added rapidly.

## Primary use cases

- **Onramp:** Enable your users to easily deposit crypto into your application using various fiat payment methods like bank transfers, mobile wallets, and other local payment channels.
- **Offramp:** Allow your users to conveniently convert their tokens held in your dApp or wallet into fiat currencies, enabling easy withdrawal and spending.
