Onboard Connect provides two integration options for enabling on and off-ramp functionality in your Web3 wallets and dApps:

- **Low-code Integration:** Quickly embed a hosted on/off-ramp flow by redirecting users to an Onboard-hosted redirect URL. This option is ideal for rapid deployment and requires minimal coding.
