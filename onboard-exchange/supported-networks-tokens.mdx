title: 'Networks & Tokens'
---

Onboard Exchange operates in a non-custodial manner, powered by smart contracts. This approach prioritizes security and user control over their funds.

While the [underlying protocol](/protocol-concepts/scea-overview) is compatible across all EVM chains, Onboard Exchange itself currently supports selected networks, to ensure robust liquidity and a smooth user experience. However, we're constantly evaluating and adding new networks to Exchange, so stay tuned for updates as we expand our network coverage!

Below is a list of supported networks & tokens on mainnet, as well as testnet, allowing you to test your integration before deployment.

## Mainnet Chains

|Chain name | Chain ID | Onboard network ID | Supported Tokens |
